# eslint-config-orbitdb

The eslint configuration used for orbit-db projects

## Using in your project

Install [eslint](https://eslint.org), the [OrbitDB linting rules](https://github.com/orbitdb/eslint-config-orbitdb) and add them to your project's dev dependencies:
```
npm install eslint @orbitdb/eslint-config-orbitdb --save-dev
```

Create `.eslintrc` file in your project's root directory:
```
touch .eslintrc
```

Edit `.eslintrc` to contain:
```json
{
  "extends": ["@orbitdb/eslint-config-orbitdb"]
}
```

Add a `lint` script to your project's `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js src/"
}
```

*Note: The lint script needs to call "./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js" instead of "eslint" as users may have global installation of eslint which uses *only* the plugins installed globally and will not find @orbitdb/eslint-config-orbitdb module (nor its dependencies). See more info [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6732) or [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1238).*

Finally, to test it all works, run the linter:
```
npm run lint
```
