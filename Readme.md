## Deprecation Notice

For now, this repository is deprecated, as we are using [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) for our linting. If we decide to go back to using specialized rules, we'll re-use this repository.

Feel free to open an issue if you have issues with standard, or any other questions around linting.
